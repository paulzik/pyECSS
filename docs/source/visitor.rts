Visitor pattern
=================

The basics
------------------------------
The Visitor pattern is a design pattern in object-oriented programming that allows you to add new operations to a set of related objects without modifying the objects themselves. It is used when you have a complex object structure that you want to perform various operations on, and you don't want to modify the existing code for these operations.
